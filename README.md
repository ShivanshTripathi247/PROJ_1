## Architecture

### Hardware Layer

- **Raspberry Pi**: Main edge computing device.
- **Sensors**:
  - **IMU (Triaxial Accelerometer + Gyroscope)**: Captures motion data for fall detection.
  - **MAX30102**: Optical pulse oximeter measuring heart rate (bpm) and blood oxygen (SpO2).
  - **NEO-6M GPS Module**: Provides geolocation for emergency alerting.
  
### Embedded Machine Learning

- **Fall Detection Model**: A Random Forest classifier processes IMU + heart rate data for real-time fall prediction on-device.
- **Data Pipeline**: Sensor data is stored and updated continuously in CSV format, facilitating live streaming and historical analytics.

### Backend Layer

- **Flask & Flask-SocketIO**: Provides REST APIs and bidirectional WebSocket streaming of sensor data and ML inference results.
- **Gemini LLM Integration**: Google's Gemini language model is integrated to generate AI-powered personalized health reports by analyzing sensor datasets.

### Frontend Layer

- **React Dashboard**: Displays real-time vitals, detected events, and live sensor graphs.
- **AI Health Reports**: Interactive report page displaying detailed AI-generated summaries, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations.
- **Emergency Alert Integration**: Alerts include GPS location sharing for rapid assistance during falls or critical health events.
